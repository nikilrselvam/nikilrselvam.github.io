I'm a first year CS PhD student at Stanford University. I recently graduated from UCLA majoring in CS and Math, and I was fortunate to be advised by [Guy Van Den Broeck](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/) at the [Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/).

My primary research interests lie in **probabilistic modeling, learning, and inference**. I also deeply care about building towards **trustworthy AI**, and my research often touches on my interests in **fairness, robustness, and explainability** in probabilistic models.
